We are 3 web developers in Lotus:

A: Ahlam Kadour @Ahlamkadour1992

J: Jasmine Badrih @Jasmineb2011

A: Aman Halabi @amanhalabyar

We created an app called [ToDoApp](file:///home/jasmine/Lotus/week-3/ToDoApp-AJA/index.html). The todo name came from "what the user is going to do today". The user can add his todo schedule, and since he's done doing it, he has the ability to delete it by the delete button or to mark it by the mark.
For this project, we used Test-driven development (TDD) method in javascript to test our functions before writing the code, so we can think exactly what we want the code to do before start writing it:

Also, we used tape (tap-producing test harness for node and browsers) to run the tests in terminal.

We used some methods to create this app:
<li> html- To add a description to our browser. </li>
<li> css- To decorate the browser. </li>
<li> javascript- To add functions that apply the user's commands. </li>
