People need a list to mark their tasks and/or to add their daily tasks.
This is our app thaat we created called ToDoApp
<!-- (link ToDoApp) -->

We used couple of method to create this app:
<li> html </li>
<li> css </li>
<li> javascript </li>
<li> DOM (inside javascript) - to add styles to our browser without using css file, to call IDs  </li>
